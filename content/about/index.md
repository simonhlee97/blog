# About Jinjja Hoosier

I am a Jinjja Hoosier (a "real" Hoosier). I was born in rice fields (South Korea), grew up in corn fields (Indiana). I created this blog to share my thoughts and stuff I find interesting. Topics might range from photography, tennis, golf, movies, podcasts, basketball, music, and tech/software development I am currently learning.

Thanks.

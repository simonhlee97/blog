## About Jinjja Hoosier

I'm Simon, a Jinjja (ì§„ì§œ) Hoosier (or "real hard-core Hoosier"). I was born in rice fields (South Korea), grew up in corn fields (Indiana). I may blog about movies, news and politics, food, tech, golf, basketball, or whatever's on my mind, so who knows? ðŸ¤”

I did start a [photography blog](https://simon-pixels.netlify.app/) as well as a [tennis blog](https://threat-level-tennis.netlify.app/), so if I'm blogging on those topics, it will get published there (hopefully).

### NOW _(updated 2 May 2024)_

Moved back to Indiana late 2023, and started a new job in April 2024, working as an **automation/bot developer**.

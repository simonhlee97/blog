## About Jinjja Hoosier

I'm Simon, a Jinjja (ì§„ì§œ) Hoosier (or "real hard-core Hoosier"). I was born in rice fields (South Korea), grew up in corn fields (Indiana). I may blog about movies, news and politics, food, tech, golf, basketball, or whatever's on my mind, so who knows? ðŸ¤”

I did start a [photography blog](https://simon-pixels.netlify.app/) as well as a [tennis blog](https://threat-level-tennis.netlify.app/), so if I'm blogging on those topics, it will get published there (hopefully).

## About Sushi Spice Latte

I'm Simon. I was born in rice fields (South Korea), grew up in corn fields (Indiana). I may blog about movies, news and politics, food, tech, golf, basketball, or whatever's on my mind, so who knows? ðŸ¤” But the main thing to remember is, this project tends to be at the top of my procrastination list.

I enjoy tennis, golf, basketball, photography, podcasts, and exploring local food, especially tacos, burritos, pizza, and burgers.

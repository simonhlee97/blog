## About Jinjja Hoosier

I'm Simon, a Jinjja (ì§„ì§œ) Hoosier (or "real hard-core Hoosier"). I was born in rice fields (South Korea), grew up in corn fields (Indiana). I may blog about movies, news and politics, food, tech, golf, basketball, or whatever's on my mind, so who knows? ðŸ¤”

I enjoy tennis, golf, photography, basketball, podcasts, and exploring local food, especially tacos, burritos, pizza, and burgers.
